#ARM11 Coursework Project

This repository contains our implementation of the ARM11 Coursework as part of our Computing Pratical I module at Imperial College London. I worked in a team of four alongside Mazen Hussein, Reece Jackson and Jaimi Patel. The project was implemented entirely in C, with a Ruby testsuite.

The repository contains the following folders:
  -doc -- contains documentation in the form of a LaTEX file, explaining the process of creating our final project
  -extension -- source code for our extension, a quiz themed around *Black Lives Matter*. More information about the cause can be found [here](https://blacklivesmatter.com)
  -programs -- ~~contains source code for Part III of the project, centered around GPIO pins w/ Raspberry Pi~~ cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic
  -src -- source code for Parts I and II of the project, the implementation of an ARM11 emulator and assembler respectively.
